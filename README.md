*note this is for installs under wayland, it is likely the case that you do not
need `wl-copy/wl-paste` if using Xorg

If you do submit please make a log of version and dll overrides on
[winedb](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application&iId=18785) 

packages required
- `xclip`
- `wine`
- `wl-copy` / `wl-paste`

`./update`: will pull the latest desktop installer and copy the wine path to
`application` folder allowing for easy install

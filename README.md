# Remarkable through wine for wayland
*note this is for installs under wayland, it is likely the case that you do not
need `wl-copy/wl-paste` if using Xorg

packages required
- `xclip`
- `wine`
- `wl-copy` / `wl-paste`

`./update`: will pull the latest desktop installer and copy the wine path to
`application` folder allowing for easy install
